## Objectives
This app is a **remaster**, but I previously created a __website__ and this one is for __android__, one of the goals is to recreate the concept of weather app, but with more knowledge.

I didn't recreate the web version, because I wanted to learn another architecture (V.I.P.E.R)

## Used technologies

 - Animate_do -> (some animations)
 - mobx -> State Managements
 - crypto -> encrypted user password
 - hive -> local storage
 - location -> user actual location
 - http -> API call
 - shared_preferences -> Persist data
 - V.I.P.E.R Architecture

## Difficulties
Using the V.I.P.E.R architecture was a good challenge, not because of its folders (since it is familiar with MVVM) but because it is not the best pair with reactive programming like mobx. But it can adapt very well when creating a ViewModel for your connections

## App Images
 :warning: **IMPORTANT**: when creating the app I created several animations, now
unfortunately my computer is getting old and I can't record anymore, so I decided to take some prints.
__personally i dont like print's__ but it's all i have for now
